#### About Me

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
	

I am a <a href="https://www.conicet.gov.ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CONICET</a> funded Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://mfis.dc.exa.unrc.edu.ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Engineering and Formal Methods Group</a> working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://nmaguirre.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nazareno Aguirre</a>. 

<br>

In July 2023, I received my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAMAF</a>, University of Cordoba, Argentina. I was advised by professor <a href="https://gregistecco.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Germán Regis</a>. My work "Specification of Dynamic Models and Automatic Property Analysis with Alloy-based Tools" is available <a href="https://rdu.unc.edu.ar/handle/11086/553418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
